# freecodecamp-javascript-projects
Projects for the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certification on freecodecamp. 

This certification consists of an interactive course built to teach students `basic Javascript`, `ES6`, `regular expressions`, `debugging`, `basic data structures`, `basic algorithm scripting`, `object oriented programming`, `functional programming`, and `intermediate algorithm scripting`. 

To obtain the certification, I need(ed) to complete 5 projects in Javascript. 

To obtain credit for each project, one must:
  - Use the required starting code
  - Pass ALL automatic tests
  - Not brute-force tests

For more information on the requirements, please visit: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures

As of the writing of this READ.md on 11/29/22, I've completed: `ALL` projects.
